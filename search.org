This is a lesson on searching, or a problem in which an *agent* is given an *initial state* and a *goal state* , and it has to find a specific *set of actions* to reach the latter from the former.

* Essential Terminology

- Agent - an entity(usually a program) that is aware of its environment, perceives it a certain way and acts upon it
- State - "state" of *environment* and the *agent* itself
- Initial state - state in which the agent "begins" - where the *Search algorithm* starts
- Actions - choices we can make in any given state. We'll define a function "*ACTION(s)*" which returns a set of actions that can be executed in state *s*
- Transition model - we can define it as a function "*RESULT( s, a )*" which returns a resulting state, after performing action *a* on the state *s*
- State space - a set of all possible( reachable ) states from the *initial state* by any *sequence of actions*
- Goal test - test whether a given state is the *goal state*
- Path cost function - a number which describes the cost of taking a certain path. Usually we want the *optimal* (shortest) path, which is why we aim to find the shortest one if possible

* Data structures
Here we will declare data structures that will be used in the *Search problem*
** Node

    A simple data structure that will keep track of:

    - Current state
    - Parent node (where we came from)
    - An action which was applied to a parent node to get to the current one
    - A path cost - a number which describes the "cost" of a path( bigger means worse ) from initial state to the current one.

** Frontier

    A frontier is a simple container where we will initially store the *initial state*, and then, after we move from one state to another, we shall store in it states that can be reached from the *current state* by applying a certain *action*

** Explored set

    Explored set is where we keep track of *nodes we have visited* , so we don't end up in an *infinite loop* !

** Stack

    We will use stacks( *LIFO* ) for removing nodes from the *frontier* - we will incorporate it with the *DFS* algorithm.

** Queues

    We will use queues( *FIFO* ) for removing nodes from the *frontier* - we will incorporate it with the *BFS* algorithm

* Approach

The approach to solving a *Search problem* is the following:

    1. Start with a *frontier* that contains only *the initial state*
    2. Initialize the empty explored set
    3. Repeat the following:
       a. If the frontier is *empty*, then there is *no solution*
       b. Remove a node from the frontier - *IMPORTANT FOR OPTIMIZATION!* we can't choose randomly if we want an optimal solution. We will use *BFS* or *DFS* strategies to choose the optimal solution.
       c. If node contains a goal state - return the *solution*
       d. Add the node to the *explored set*
       e. *Expand the node* - add nodes we have "discovered" to the *frontier* ( if they already aren't in the frontier or *the explored set* )

** Depth First Search

    As mentioned before, this search algorithm utilizes *stack data structure*.

    Pros:
        - The best-case scenario is: this algorithm is the fastest if luck plays in its favor
    Cons:
        - The solution it finds *isn't guaranteed* to be optimal!
        - At worst - it explores every possible path before it finds the solution, thus taking the longest time

** Breadth First Search

    As mentioned before, this search algorithm utilizes *queue data structure*.

    Pros:
        - Guaranteed to find optimal solution - WHY?
    Cons:
        - Runs longer than minimal runtime - almost guaranteed
        - At worst, just as *DFS* , takes longest time to run.
